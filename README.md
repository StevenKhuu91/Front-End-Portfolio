Portfolio--
Collection of finished small projects I've worked on.

These are experimental codes I made in order to figure out how animations, colors, and certain design elements could slot together properly.
While unusable for web design as a whole, often I find that particular common elements can be focused on and practiced to see how they'd work with other things.
The following files are just things I've dabbled in and improved on over time, to gain a better understanding of how the pieces all slot together ( and often times don't).

As my journey of development continues I hope to flesh this out with far better examples of what I've been able to create and apply, as a visual guide to those interested in my progress.
This is also more or less a "journal" of mine as well to keep. There will be plenty of mistakes and things I could have done better, but that's all necessary for the learning process.
