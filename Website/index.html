<h1>Steven Khuu</h1>
<p>Howdy hey, I'm Steven Khuu, a self-taught Web Developer & Designer!</p>
<p>Currently studying: Javascript, React, SAAS</p>
<p>My projects: this portfolio website at the moment!</p>
<br>
<p>A firm believer in "less is more". Born in Dallas, TX. Constantly finding the perfect bridge that connects minimalist designs to user-friendly functionality. My projects are a reflection of that pursuit, along with all other things I do in life.</p>
<br>
<p>Beyond my career passions, I lead a small community as a 'Warrior of Light', collect board games, constantly find the newest places to eat at, and photograph it all for everlasting memories to fondly look back on.</p>
